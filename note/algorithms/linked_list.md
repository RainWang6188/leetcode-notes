# Linked List Notes

## 1. Mind Edge Cases
The whole point of asking any candidates a linked list problem is to test if the candidates think about edge cases, including:

- Dereferencing Null Pointer, usually targeting **tail pointer**
- When given Head is None
- When there are duplications in the list

## 2. Remind to Increment the `curr` Pointer
