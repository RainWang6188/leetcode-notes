# 135. Candy

## Description
There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
- Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

**example**
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## My Solution
I didn't figure out the correct solution...

## Classic Solution
A very clever solution solves this problem using two passes.
- In the first pass, it guarantees that any children with a higher rating gets more candies than his **left** neighbor.
- In the second pass, it guarantees that any children with a higher rating gets more candies than his **right** neighbor.

```C++
int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
    int n = ratings.size();
    vector<int> candy(n, 1);

    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if(ratings[i] < ratings[i + 1])
            candy[i + 1] = candy[i] + 1;
    }

    for(int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if(ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i]) 
            candy[i - 1] = max(candy[i] + 1, candy[i - 1]);
    }

    int sum = 0;
    for(int val : candy) 
        sum += val;

    return sum;
}
```
