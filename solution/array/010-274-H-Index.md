# 274. H-Index
## Description
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their $i^{th}$ paper, return compute the researcher's **h-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their n papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the **h-index**.

**Example**
```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

## My Solution
### 1. Sort
We can first sort the citation vector into non-increasing order. And then find the largest `h` possible. This algorithm can be illustrated as follows:

And the code is here:

```C++
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int h = 0;
        
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end(), greater<int>());
        
        for(int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i++) {
            h = (citations[i] >= i + 1) ? (i + 1) : h;
        }
        
        return h;
    }
```
