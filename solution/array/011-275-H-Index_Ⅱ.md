# H-Index Ⅱ
## Description
Given an array of integers citations where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their $i^{th}$ paper and citations is sorted in an **ascending** order, return compute the researcher's h-index.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
## My Solution
Same as [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/). From right to left, find the last element whose value is greater than or equal to its index. The index is the result.

However, my solution is not $O(\log N)$, but $O(N)$.
```C++
int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {  
    int n = citations.size();
    
    int h = 0;
    for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int index = n - i;
        h = (citations[i] >= index) ? index : h;
    }
    
    return h;
}
```

Since the question asks for a solution with $\log N$ time complexity, so we can use binary search to find the index in my solution.

We can covert it using n the length of the array. We subtract n with the index, we get:
```   
     c: 3, 3, 5, 8, 25
index0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
index1: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

We can see we almost have the original form now except the order. It is easy, in the original problem we try to find the **last** one >= its index, now we find the **first** one >= its index.

So now we just using binary search to find the number, a thing here we need to mind is the `index0` here we are using, but we need to convert it to `index1`.

```c++
int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {  
    int n = citations.size();
    int left = 0, right = n;

    while(left < right) {
        int m = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if(citations[m] < n - m)
            left = m + 1;
        else 
            right = m;
    }
    
    return n - left;
}
```
