# 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

## Description

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the Solution class:

- `Solution()` Initializes the object of the system.
- `String encode(String longUrl)` Returns a tiny URL for the given `longUrl`.
- `String decode(String shortUrl)` Returns the original long URL for the given `shortUrl`. It is guaranteed that the given `shortUrl` was encoded by the same object.
 
**Example:**
```
Input: url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Output: "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"

Explanation:
Solution obj = new Solution();
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after deconding it.
```

## Classic Solution

We can use an `unordered_map<string, int>` and `unordered_map<int, string>` to set up the mapping between the original url and the code (we'll use a counter as the code).

```C++
